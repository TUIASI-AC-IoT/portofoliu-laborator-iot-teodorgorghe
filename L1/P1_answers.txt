1) The purpose of the gpio_config function is to configure the GPIO interface, in order to allow the CPU to read/output digital pin voltage (there are some register, gates, on the hardware scheme)
A GPIO pin can be configured as an output/input. Also, acording to the documentation, the pin can be configured as pull down/pull up (using internal pull-up/down resistors), or add handles for the interrupt (when value changes or when on the latch).

GPIO_MODE_DISABLE
GPIO mode : disable input and output

GPIO_MODE_INPUT
GPIO mode : input only

GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT
GPIO mode : output only mode

GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT_OD
GPIO mode : output only with open-drain mode

GPIO_MODE_INPUT_OUTPUT_OD
GPIO mode : output and input with open-drain mode

GPIO_MODE_INPUT_OUTPUT
GPIO mode : output and input mode

vTaskDelay delays the current task with the number of ticks. In order to delay the task in miliseconds, tick rate have been converted into ms.

In documentation it's not well explicty specified why the entry function is called app_main, but there can be several reasons:
- In order to boot the application, the platform first reaches some steps: loading First stage bootloader, which is hard coded in the chip. The FSB loads SSB, which is stored on the flash. After, SSB loads AN application, acording to a specific configuration (see my undergratuate project for further details). By default configuration, the flash memory has only one application, stored at a specific address. That application includes FreeRTOS stuff, and the entry point the application is main_task. From the main_task, leads to our application entry point, app_main.
